# data-analysis-portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! 

## Background
I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (General Management) from California State University, East Bay in 2020. During a Marketing Research course, I found that I love working with data in any capacity. I was inspired to complete Google's Data Analysis Professional Certificate and loved every minute of it. As I complete the next logical step in becoming a Data Analyst, I hope to develop the skills I've been learning in a capacity that can improve decision-making and automate redundant processes. I would also love to contribute to the company's culture that they've cultivated to make working a more enjoyable experience for everyone.

This repository is a collection of the work that I've completed to show off my skills, receive feedback on how I can improve, and track my progress in Data Analytics. If you want to discuss any of my projects further, leave a suggestion, or have a quick chat, please feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanvde/)!
