# Background
I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (General Management) from California State University, East Bay in 2020. During a Marketing Research course, I found that I love working with data in any capacity. I was inspired to complete **Google's Data Analysis Professional Certificate**, hosted by *Coursera*, and loved every minute of it. 

Now that I'm comfortable writing semi-complicated SQL queries, capable of performing Exploratory Data Analysis with Python using the pandas
and Numpy libraries, and competent in creating dashboards to visualize KPIs using Tableau, I wanted to put all my projects in a singular place and show off my work.

Here's a picture of me and my future dog (they're too cute!!!).

### About Me
I enjoy listening to all kinds of music, snowboarding (any sport really), and anything that brings out my competitive nature. I found that video games are a great way to challenge my decision-making, leadership capabilities, and my ability to understand situations at a macro level. I've placed consistently in the top 1% of players in numerous online games and understand how to translate *strategy* into *actionable plans* that lead to the **highest** probability of success.

# Goal
As I complete the next logical step in becoming a Data Analyst, I hope to develop the skills I've been learning in a capacity that can improve decision-making and automate redundant processes. I would also love to contribute to the company's culture that they've cultivated to make working a more enjoyable experience for everyone.

This repository is a collection of the work that I've completed to show off my skills, receive feedback on how I can improve, and track my progress in Data Analytics.
